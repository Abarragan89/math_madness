# Math Madness

## This is an app for kids to practice their multiplication. The goal is to get the highest score you can in the alloted time. The score is determined by how fast they can answer each question. The problem timer is multiplied by 5 and added to their score. 
## As a teacher, I know that multiplication is not fun to study. This game is meant to motivate students to learn their multiplication and compete with friends
## I am the sole creator of this app and it needs lots of updating. This is my first attempt at making a working application without following any book examples.
## This is 'spagehetti' code. I plan to update this code to make it Object-Oriented while still using vanilla javascript. This will help me solve a few bugs I have with the reset button

## Intended Updates
### Make object-oriented to make a settings page to customize level of multiplication facts and timer
### Add addition, subtraction, and division versions
